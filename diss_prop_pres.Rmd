# Futurity and Epistemicity

* Expression of futurity in Spanish:
    * Complex phenomenon **(e.g., Azpiazu, 2024; Comrie, 1985; Escandell-Vidal, 2014, 2019; Gennari, 2000)**
    
    * Prime example of diachronic linguistic variation leading to a language change **(Orozco, 2022)**
        * Morphological Future (MF)
        * Periphrastic Future (PF)
        * Present Indicative (PI)
        * Present Progressive (PP)
        * (...)

* Futurity **&rarr;** Epistemic Modality

* Some definitions:
  * Future: an event or state posterior to the moment of speech **(Comrie, 1985; Reichenbach, 1947)**
  
  * Epistemicity: speaker's level of certainty toward the utterance **(Gennari, 2000; Kearns, 2011)**

# The Current Project

Four goals **&rarr;** Three studies:

1. To focus on synchronic variation in language contact situations **&rarr;** **Spanish-English early bilinguals** in the U.S.

2. To examine the linguistic factors that constrain the uses of the MF, the PF, and the PI with both future and epistemic readings (Study 1)

3. To explore the variable use of the PI and the PP in contexts of futurity (Study 2)

4. To analyze the knowledge of the prospective and epistemic MF to better understand the semantic-pragmatic values that early bilinguals associate with this form (Study 3)

---
# Study 1

.black[Goal:] To examine the synchronic variation of the canonical forms to express futurity in Spanish by **U.S.** **Spanish-English early bilinguals**

### Research Questions

1. What are the rates of use of the MF, the PF, and the PI with future readings among **Spanish-English early bilinguals** in the U.S.?

2. a) What are the effects of temporal distance, grammatical person, and verb class on the uses of these three forms? <br>
  
  b) Is there an interaction between temporal distance and grammatical person in the use of the MF, the PF, and the PI?
  
3. Are the MF, the PF, and/or the PI used to convey epistemicity among these speakers? 

4. What is the effect of adverb specification, verb class, and type of bilingualism on the epistemic uses of these forms? 

---
### Methods

* *Corpus del Español en Arizona, CESA* **(Carvalho, 2012-)** and *Spanish in Texas Corpus, STC* **(Bullock & Toribio, 2024)**

* Preliminary analysis using 'spaCy' **(Honnibal et al., 2020)**, open-source library for NLP in Python **&rarr;** 2,491 data points
    * 475 tokens for the MF
    * 2,016 tokens for the PF
    * PI not included &rarr; 'spaCy' not trained to detect pragmatic nuances

* Envelope of variation &rarr; The context in which the forms selected for the analysis are “functionally parallel as well as variable” **(Tagliamonte, 2012, p. 10)**:
    * Futurity
    * Epistemic modality

**Specify coding procedure?**

???
Coding procedure: 
  * Linguistic factors:
      * Reading: prospective, epistemic
      * Form: MF, PF, PI
      * Temporal distance: immediate, close, distant
      * Grammatical person (proxy of certainty)
      * Verb class: dynamic, motion, stative, psychological, perceptual
      * Adverb specification: yes, no
  * Social factors:
      * Participant id
      * Type of bilingualism: sequential, simultaneous
      * Age (continuous measure)

---
### Statistical Analysis

* Two subsets: future reference uses and epistemic uses 

* Future reference uses:
    * Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model in R **(R Core Team, 2022)**
    * Form ~ temporal distance + grammatical person + verb class (+ age) + temporal distance:grammatical person

* Epistemic uses:
    * Hard to tell *a priori*: bi/multinomial logistic regression model vs descriptive stats 
    * IF a model can be built... <br> Form ~ adverb specification + verb class + type of bilingualism (+ age)
    * IF a model cannot be built... <br> Descriptive stats + cross-tabulation of factors

---
# Study 2
.black[Goal:] To examine the reported preference for the expression of futurity in Spanish by **U.S.** **Spanish-English early bilinguals**, with a focus on less studied forms in previous research (i.e., PF, PI, and PP).

### Research Questions

1. To what degree do  **Spanish-English early bilinguals** in the U.S. report preference for the use of the PF, the PI, and the PP to express futurity?

2. What effect do temporal reference and plan certainty have on the reported usage preferences of these forms, and is there a relationship between these two factors? 

3. a) How do the results of the bilinguals compare to that of Spanish monolinguals? <br>
  
  b) If there are differences between groups, can they be better explained by contact with English or by an internally motivated change in progress in the Spanish language?

# Study 3

.black[Goal:] To examine the knowledge of the semantic values of the Spanish MF by **U.S.** **Spanish-English early bilinguals**.

### Research Questions

1. a) Do **Spanish-English early bilinguals** distinguish between prospective and epistemic uses of the MF when presented with competing interpretations? <br>

  b) Is their interpretation of the MF modulated by Spanish proficiency?

2. How do their interpretations compare with those of monolinguals speakers of Spanish?
